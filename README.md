# Kaggle-Competition----Estimate-the-Square-Footage-of-a-Virtual-City
There are many different ways that engineers measure cities. What is the population? What is the total land area occupied by the city. In this exercise, we will see if you can create a model to predict the square feet contained in various virtual cities.

You are provided with images looking towards the city center. Each image is 512x512, compressed with JPEG. The following sample image shows a typical view of a virtual city. You can see towers of a variety of sizes and colors.
